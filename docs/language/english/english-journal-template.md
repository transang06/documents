## 🗓 Date: 2025-07-01

### 📌 What did I learn today?
Today I explored how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works in LangChain using ChromaDB and Groq LLM. I learned how retrievers and generators are connected.

### ⚠️ What was difficult?
Understanding how the retriever filters relevant chunks was a bit confusing. I will re-read the part about `as_retriever()` and vector similarity.

### 🧠 Keywords I want to remember
- RAG
- Retriever
- Chunking
- Cosine similarity

### 📝 Sentences I practiced
- "Today I built a simple RAG pipeline using LangChain."
- "Retrievers are crucial in grounding LLMs with factual data."
